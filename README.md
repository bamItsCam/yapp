# YAPP - Yet Another Pointing Poker
tl;dr: you should probably just use https://www.pointingpoker.com/

This is a basic pointing poker calculator that dev teams can use to estimate development complexity.

The objective of this side-project was to learn htmx, sse, and golang html templating, not create a pointing poker. Therefore, there are no guarantees on how reliable or usable this is as a real tool - it was a cool excuse to learn something new. If you need a pointing poker, I would be honored if you used this, but there are better tools out there.
